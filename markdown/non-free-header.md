# Awesome Selfhosted - Non-Free Software

**Software listed here does not meet the [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) definition**. It implements their own licensing with restrictions and grants which you must check on each case. Restrictions may include limits on allowed use of the software, access to the source code, modification and further redistribution. This software can therefore contain anti user-freedom features, such as but not limited to: backdoors, user lock-in, sending personal data to a third party.
